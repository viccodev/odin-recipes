    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      I first tasted arepas at a New York City hole-in-the-wall eatery and I
      fell in love with this stuffed white corn cake. Halfway through my first
      arepa — one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, and salty cheese —
      I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a truly magnificent
      delivery system for any number of your favorite fillings. I went with some
      spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a few days later stuffed with
      caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.

    <!--Recipe ingredients-->

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Recipe How to step by step-->

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p> Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough. </p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty. </p>
    
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle. </p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket. </p>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
